    Relativity

    for Stephen Hawking

    When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark
    our pupils grope for the shape of things we know.

    Photons loosed from slits like greyhounds at the track
    reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows

    that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall—particles no more—
    and with a wave bid all certainties goodbye.

    For what’s sure in a universe that dopplers
    away like a siren’s midnight cry? They say

    a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train
    will explain why time dilates like a perfect

    afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines
    will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight,

    bent in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think
    this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?
